  qa: {
    whatIs: {
      answer: `Vocal Remover is a free browser-based tool that creates instrumental versions of songs by removing vocals. It uses audio phase cancellation—since vocals are typically mixed in the center (equal in both stereo channels), subtracting the channels cancels them out while preserving stereo-panned instruments.`,
      context: `Perfect for creating karaoke tracks, practicing instruments along with songs, or sampling music.`
    },
    howItWorks: {
      steps: [
        'Drag and drop a stereo audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A)',
        'Preview the original audio to verify it loaded correctly',
        'Adjust the vocal removal strength slider (higher = more aggressive removal)',
        'Click "Remove Vocals" to process the audio',
        'Listen to the result and download the instrumental as WAV'
      ]
    },
    whyBrowserBased: {
      benefits: [
        'Privacy first: Audio files never leave your device',
        'Instant processing: No upload wait—uses Web Audio API directly',
        'Adjustable: Fine-tune removal strength for best results per song',
        'No limits: Process as many songs as you want without quotas',
        'Offline capable: Works without internet after page loads'
      ]
    },
    faqs: [
      {
        question: 'Why do I need stereo audio files?',
        answer: `Phase cancellation works by subtracting left and right channels. Mono files have identical channels, so there's nothing to cancel. Most commercial music is stereo, but check your source file if vocal removal fails.`
      },
      {
        question: 'Why are some vocals still audible?',
        answer: `Phase cancellation only removes center-panned audio. If vocals have stereo effects (reverb, delay, panning), those portions will remain. Songs with dry, centered vocals work best.`
      },
      {
        question: 'Will this affect the instruments too?',
        answer: `Center-panned instruments (like bass and kick drum) may be reduced along with vocals. Higher removal strength increases this effect. Start with medium strength and adjust as needed.`
      },
      {
        question: 'What audio formats are supported?',
        answer: `MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, and FLAC are supported. The file must be stereo (2 channels). Output is always WAV format for maximum quality.`
      },
      {
        question: 'How does this compare to AI vocal removal?',
        answer: `AI methods (like Spleeter or Demucs) can isolate vocals more precisely but require server processing. Phase cancellation is less accurate but works instantly in your browser with complete privacy.`
