      answer: `The EXIF Metadata Editor is a free privacy tool that lets you view and remove hidden data from your photos before sharing them online. Every photo taken with a smartphone or digital camera contains EXIF metadata—including your exact GPS coordinates, camera model, date/time, and sometimes even your name. This tool helps you see exactly what data is embedded and remove it to protect your privacy.`,
      context: `Essential for anyone sharing photos on social media, dating apps, or selling items online where location privacy matters.`

    faqs: [
      {
        question: 'Why should I remove GPS data from photos?',
        answer: `Photos often contain your exact location coordinates. Sharing these online can reveal your home address, workplace, or frequently visited locations. This is especially risky on dating apps, social media, or when selling items online. Removing GPS data protects your physical safety and privacy.`
      },
      {
        question: 'What EXIF data can reveal my location?',
        answer: `GPS coordinates embedded in photos can pinpoint your exact location to within a few meters. Combined with timestamps, this data can reveal your daily routines, home location, workplace, and places you visit. Even a single photo can expose sensitive location information.`
      },
      {
        question: 'Does this work on iPhone and Android photos?',
        answer: `Yes, both iPhone and Android phones embed EXIF data including GPS coordinates by default. This tool reads and removes metadata from any JPEG photo regardless of which device captured it.`
      },
      {
        question: 'Why only JPEG images?',
        answer: `JPEG is the standard format for photos and stores EXIF metadata in a specific format. PNG, WebP, and other formats use different metadata systems or don't support EXIF at all. Most camera and phone photos are JPEGs.`
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens to the image quality when metadata is removed?',
        answer: `Image quality is completely preserved. Removing EXIF metadata only affects the hidden data header, not the actual image pixels. Your photos will look exactly the same before and after cleaning.`
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I view metadata without modifying the photo?',
        answer: `Yes, simply upload your photo to view all embedded metadata. You can examine GPS coordinates, camera settings, dates, and other information without making any changes. Only click the strip buttons when you want to remove data.`
