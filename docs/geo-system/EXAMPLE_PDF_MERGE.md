PDF Merge is a free browser-based tool that combines multiple PDF files into one document in seconds. Unlike Adobe Acrobat, it processes files entirely in your browser without uploading to servers. Simply drag-and-drop your PDFs, arrange them in order, and click merge to download your combined file. Perfect for organizing documents, creating portfolios, and managing paperwork.
```

### 3. Semantic Q&A Sections

#### Q1: "Is PDF Merge really free?"
**Answer**: Yes, PDF Merge is 100% free with no hidden costs. We don't require account creation or email signup. All processing happens in your browser - your PDFs never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy and security. There are no watermarks, file limits, or processing restrictions.

#### Q2: "What file formats does PDF Merge support?"
**Answer**: PDF Merge supports all PDF versions including PDF/A and encrypted files (if you have the password). Maximum combined file size is 100MB. For best results, use standard PDF files with text and images. The tool preserves all original formatting, bookmarks, and metadata.

#### Q3: "How long does PDF merging take?"
**Answer**: Processing time depends on file size and quantity. Merging 5 standard documents (2-3 pages each) typically takes 10-15 seconds. The tool uses WebAssembly for fast client-side processing, making it 3x faster than server-based alternatives. Larger files may take 30-60 seconds.

#### Q4: "Is PDF Merge safe to use?"
**Answer**: Absolutely. All processing happens locally in your browser. We never upload your files to servers, ensuring complete privacy. The tool uses advanced JavaScript libraries and is regularly audited for security vulnerabilities. Your PDFs remain on your device throughout the entire process.

#### Q5: "Can I merge PDFs on mobile?"
**Answer**: Yes, PDF Merge works on any device with a modern browser - phones, tablets, laptops, or desktops. It's optimized for touch interfaces and supports file selection from cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox). The interface adapts to your screen size for easy use on any device.

#### Q6: "What's the difference between PDF Merge and Adobe Acrobat?"
**Answer**: PDF Merge offers three key advantages: it's completely free, processes files privately in your browser, and requires no software installation. Unlike Adobe's $12.99/month subscription, we have no watermarks or limitations. Plus, you can use it instantly without creating an account.

#### Q7: "Can I rearrange pages before merging?"
**Answer**: Yes, PDF Merge includes a visual page organizer. After uploading your files, you can drag and drop individual pages to reorder them, remove unwanted pages, or rotate pages before merging. This gives you complete control over the final document structure.
