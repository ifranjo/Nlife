## Validation Checklist

Before building ANY of these, validate:

### 1. Search Volume
```
Use Google Keyword Planner or Ubersuggest:
- "invoice to excel" → How many searches/month?
- Low competition + decent volume = opportunity
```

### 2. Existing Solutions
```
Search the main keyword. What do you find?
- No good solutions = blue ocean
- Many solutions = need differentiator
- One dominant player = hard to compete
```

### 3. Willingness to Pay
```
Look at competitor pricing:
- If competitors charge $X, market accepts $X
- If no competitors, harder to know
- Look for pain signals (Reddit complaints, forum posts)
```

### 4. Your Advantage
```
What makes YOUR version better?
- Privacy (client-side processing)
- Price (free tier, lower cost)
- Simplicity (one feature done perfectly)
- Speed (instant results)
```

## Build vs Integrate

### Build Standalone
```
New domain: invoicepdftoexcel.com
Pros: Clear positioning, SEO focus
Cons: New traffic, new brand

Best for: High-conviction ideas worth investing in
```

### Integrate into NEW_LIFE
```
Add to existing suite: newlifesolutions.dev/tools/invoice-converter
Pros: Existing traffic, shared infrastructure
Cons: Diluted focus, harder to monetize individually

Best for: Testing ideas before spinning off
```

### Recommended Approach
```
1. Build MVP inside NEW_LIFE
2. Validate with real users
3. If traction → spin off to dedicated domain
4. If no traction → keep as free tool, try next idea
```

## The BSC Mindset

```
Angus didn't try to build the best PDF tool.
He built the best BANK STATEMENT converter.

Don't try to build the best transcription tool.
Build the best INTERVIEW transcription tool.

Don't try to build the best background remover.
Build the best PRODUCT PHOTO background remover.

Niche down. Own your space.
$40K/month comes from being #1 in a small market,
not #100 in a big market.
```
