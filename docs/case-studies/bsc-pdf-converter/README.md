## Why This Works

### 1. Painful Problem + Specific Audience
- Accountants HATE manually transcribing bank statements
- They do this task repeatedly (not one-time)
- Time = money for professionals
- They'll pay to save hours of tedious work

### 2. Zero Competition Mindset
- Not competing with Adobe, Microsoft, or big PDF tools
- Hyper-specific: "bank statements" not "any PDF"
- Owns the long-tail keyword space

### 3. Built-in Virality
- Accountants talk to other accountants
- Professional networks share tools
- Zero CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
