    questions:
      - question: "What is Base64 used for?"
        answer: "Base64 encodes binary data (like images) as text for use in web pages, APIs, emails, and anywhere text is required but binary data needs to be transmitted."
      - question: "Does Base64 encryption make files secure?"
        answer: "No. Base64 is encoding, not encryption. It doesn't provide security—it's easily reversible by anyone."
      - question: "Why are Base64 files larger?"
        answer: "Base64 encoding increases file size by approximately 33% because it represents binary data using text characters."
